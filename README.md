# Learning / Tweaking UMAP

Created in part to better understand the algorithm; tweaked to make it more pythonic; substituted the nearest-neighbour search to the version suggested in the 
LargeVis paper.

See the <a href="https://github.com/lmcinnes/">original repo</a> for multithreaded/numba code. Mine isn't actually slower for small datasets but getting to ~10000 points in 50 dimensions and I just can't match with a single threaded implementation. I do find that batches improve the convergence tremendously so I may come back to this code to parallelize/gpu-ize it.
